## DESCRIPTION
This app is created to make my life easier as a DM of a ttrpg. It shuffles a deck of runes lore related to create a prediction about the consultant request.
Its functionality is almost done, I'm still hesitant about the interface and how to approach it.

## EXPLANATION
This is a simple app coded with python.
I used the shuffle function from random to get an unordered dic out of the mazo file which then is trimmed with the .pop() function that, passing it two variables, in turn gives it the text that's going to be shown on screen. 
The if sequences are just to give a soft sensation of personalization and to offer a small amount of options.
